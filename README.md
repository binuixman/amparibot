# amparibot

IRC bot that can be used to query CheapShark API for free games.
IRC portion of the code courtesy to https://www.techbeamers.com/create-python-irc-bot/.

## USAGE:

Edit bot_startup.py to fit your needs, then run it (preferably in its own *screen*).
Currently, the bot can only query the list of games on script start up.

## TODO list:

- query games on set intervals
- command to list games from a given store
